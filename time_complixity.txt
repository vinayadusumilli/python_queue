Let's analyze the time complexity of each method in your `Queue` class implemented using `collections.deque`:

### 1. `__init__(self, size)`
- **Operation**: Initializes an empty deque with a maximum length (`maxlen`).
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(1) \)

### 2. `add_element(self, data)`
- **Operation**: Adds an element to the end of the deque using `append()`.
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(1) \)
- **Explanation**: Appending to either end of a deque is \( O(1) \) on average.

### 3. `remove_element(self)`
- **Operation**: Removes an element from the front of the deque using `popleft()`.
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(1) \)
- **Explanation**: Removing from the left end of a deque is \( O(1) \).

### 4. `display(self)`
- **Operation**: Prints all elements in the deque.
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
- **Explanation**: Displaying all elements requires iterating through the entire deque, where \( n \) is the current number of elements.

### Summary of Time Complexity
| **Method**        | **Time Complexity** |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| `__init__`        | \( O(1) \)          |
| `add_element`     | \( O(1) \)          |
| `remove_element`  | \( O(1) \)          |
| `display`         | \( O(n) \)          |

### Overall
- The `Queue` operations (`add_element` and `remove_element`) are very efficient with \( O(1) \) time complexity, thanks to `collections.deque`.
- Displaying the queue has a linear time complexity \( O(n) \), which is expected since you need to visit each element to display them all.

This makes your `Queue` class efficient for typical queue operations.
